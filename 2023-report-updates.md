# Methodological updates to 2023 report 
## Universities and regional economic growth: an updated analysis of future impact

This document summarises key methodological changes introduced for the 2023 future impact report update. It should be read in conjunction with the original Technical note which accompanied the 2021 report.

1. In the analysis of key workers (table 1), dentists are now included with medics (now doctors and dentists).
2. Table 2 from the 2021 report has been removed. This was drawn from table 189 of the Employer Skills Survey (ESS) 2019. An update of this survey is due later in 2023. Table 4 from the previous report (the proportion of all universities in each region who indicated that they provided particular services) has also been removed, as this has been paused in the Higher Education Business and Community Interaction (HEBCI) survey.
3. Trend analyses are based on a start date of 30 June 2023. In the previous report this date was 31 May 2021.
4. Data tables 3 (forecast of the value of training and upskilling provided by universities), 5 (the forecast value of intellectual property interactions), and 10 (forecast of the number of people attending public events delivered by universities) are new for this report. They follow the standard trend analysis approach detailed in the Technical note.
5. Table 8 (the forecast number of new companies and charities to be formed) now also follows the standard trend analysis approach. In the previous report, it was calculated based on an average of spin-offs created per region per year over the past five years.
6. The analysis of projects funded by Innovate UK (table 7) covers the period 2004 to 12 May 2023. The totals cover funding to UK-based academic organisations only. In the previous 2021 report, funding to catapults, research and technology organisations (RTOs), public sector research establishments (PSREs), public sector organisations (PSOs), and charities were also included.
7. Tables 12 and 13 focus on higher education staff, and exclude those on atypical contracts. For this year, 2021/22, 87 higher education providers in England and Northern Ireland opted out of returning information about non-academic staff. 66 providers opted-out in the previous report (which drew on HESA data for 2019/20).
8. Employment data for table 13 is based on March 2023 ONS figures, published May 2023.
