## Universities and the UK’s economic recovery: an analysis of future impact

This research uses historic data to predict future impact. The exact methods differ depending on the data source and are detailed below. However, we make several assumptions: that the economic and policy environment remains stable, that universities continue to be able to engage in similar activities and are supported to do so, and that demographic trends and the number and make up of businesses remains the same.

Given the widespread disruption of COVID-19, and other events with wide-reaching effects such as the UK withdrawal from the EU, conditions have changed markedly compared to previous years and will affect the forecasts. Understanding the direction of changes is complex. For example, the pandemic has had significant impact on employment and on businesses, and government borrowing has soared. However, the Bank of England expects the UK economy to [recover rapidly in late 2021](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2021/may-2021). The end of support from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programme in 2023 will mean UK nations and English regions are unable to access this funding, which has underpinned many job creation and regeneration projects. However, the UK government is expected to launch the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF) in 2022, and has promised the amounts will eventually at least match those of ESIF. In addition, specific policies may affect the accuracy of forecasts – these are detailed below. 

## Methods by data table

**Data table 1 and footnote 3** are based on university returns to the HESA Student Data survey 2019/20. For this, and other (non-HEBCI) HESA data, information on English regions was manually added as this is not included in the data. Those on HESA’s ‘alternative record’ are not included; this was to enable geocoding and comparability with the HEBCI data (all UUK members are included). Subjects are classified according to HESA’s Common Aggregation Hierarchy (CAH), which allows us to pull out data on enrolments and qualifiers in key worker fields. The category of ‘nursing’ constructed for this research, for example, includes nine different fields, ranging from mental health nursing to midwifery. The category of ‘medics’ (constructed for this research) includes medicine by specialism (CAH01-01-03), medicine (non-specific) (CAH01-01-02), and medical sciences (non-specific) (CAH01-01-01), but excludes dentistry (CAH01-01-04). This subject coding system is new for the 2019/20 data release.

In these returns, HESA distinguish between all those enrolled in a course, and those who graduated with a qualification in the period of the survey (2019/20). Those _enrolled_ represent the stock of students working their way through university, in different years of study. This is the pipeline. _Qualifiers_ are those who have now finished their programme of study. The projection of key workers over the following years is based on the most recent year of qualifiers. Numbers will fluctuate from year-to-year, and there are several reasons why these projections may actually be underestimates. First, the government has [lifted the cap](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3358) on medical school places in England, and [five new medical schools](https://www.hee.nhs.uk/news-blogs-events/news/new-medical-schools-open-train-doctors-future) have opened in underrepresented parts of the country in recent years. [Record numbers](https://www.ucas.com/corporate/news-and-key-documents/news/more-people-ever-want-be-doctor) of people have applied to medicine courses since onset of the pandemic, and the number of people starting initial teacher training (ITT) courses in England alone [rose by 23 percent](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/initial-teacher-training-census/2020-21) this year (there were 41,472 new entrants to ITT in England for 2020/21). Second, HESA [acknowledge](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/27-01-2021/sb258-higher-education-student-statistics/qualifications) that ‘significant numbers’ of qualifications awarded this year (upon which projections are based) are likely to have not been reported, because a few providers experienced administrative delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Data table 2** is from table 189 of the Employer Skills Survey (ESS) 2019. The survey collected data from over 81,000 employers, but does not cover Scotland (the Scottish Government published the [Scottish Employer Perspectives Survey 2019](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2019/12/scottish-employer-perspectives-survey-eps-2019-official-statistics-publication/documents/employer-perspectives-survey-2019/employer-perspectives-survey-2019/govscot%3Adocument/employer-perspectives-survey-2019.pdf), but this does not have comparable data).

**Data tables 3, 5, 6 and 9** are taken from the Higher Education Business and Community Interaction (HEBCI) survey, managed by HESA. Up to five years of data was analysed (2014/15 to 2018/19). Data was aggregated by region, and then a trend analysis applied. In basic terms, this applies a line of best fit to the data (using the least squares method), and then extends it forwards over the time scale we choose – in this case, yearly intervals from the end of May 2021. This allows us to ‘smooth out’ any unusual peaks or dips in the data and pick out overall trends, although it remains an imperfect science best suited for illustrating the overall direction of travel.

Plotted forecasts were then summed to form cumulative totals for one year, 18 months, two years, and five year projections. In other words, the projected figure for five years is the total of the forecast figures for five separate years: 31 May 2022, 31 May 2023, 31 May 2024, and so on.

**Data table 4** is the proportion of all universities in each region who indicated that they provided particular services in the most recent HEBCI survey (2018-19).

**Data table 7** presents information on the projects funded by Innovate UK between 2004 and 1 April 2021 in four major sectoral areas which make up the majority of overall funding. The totals cover funding to UK-based academic organisations, catapults, research and technology organisations (RTOs), public sector research establishments (PSREs), public sector organisations (PSOs), and charities; totals do not include funding to businesses. Total project funding is usually higher than the amount provided by Innovate UK, as partners also give cash or in-kind contributions. The accompanying text provides calculations on the percentage of funding _per region_ spent in each sector area, as a proportion of the total funding for the four sectors. A high number indicates the region received more funding for a sector area compared to other sector areas. The _Universities and colleges and the Industrial Strategy: exploring data on knowledge exchange, research and skills_ report [technical appendix](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/Reports/isc-technical-appendix.pdf) (PDF, 466kb)  has a good summary of the strengths and limitations of this dataset.

**Data table 8** is the forecast of newly registered companies. It is also drawn from the HEBCI survey, and data was analysed from 2014/15 to 2018/19. Given the lower figures here compared to income data, and greater volatility, an average was calculated of spin-offs created per region per year over the past five years, rather than a trend analysis. This average was then projected forwards over the different timeframes.

**Data tables 10 and 11** are also drawn from HESA data for 2019/20, and are calculated on an FTE basis for comparability and a more accurate reflection of contribution. The data for staff is an under-count: from 2019/20, it is not mandatory for HE providers in England and Northern Ireland to return information about non-academic staff, and 66 universities opted-out. The same caveat applies for the calculation of 14,135 new jobs created (the text beneath table 11), which uses headcount data to calculate the change in employment at universities over the past five years, and means the increase is likely considerably higher in reality.

**Data table 12** uses the same data as above for staff numbers, but on a headcount basis and excludes atypical staff. This is to allow calculation of regional employment on the basis of ONS figures, which are from August 2020 to align roughly with the collection of HESA data and give greater accuracy.

**Data table 13** shows university expenditure on staff by region. It is extracted from the ‘consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expenditure’ in the HESA finance returns for 2018/19.
